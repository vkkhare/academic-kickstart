**Objective**: _Monocular 3D object instance recognition and Pose Estimation_

* Worked under the guidance of [Prof. Tat Seng Chua](https://www.chuatatseng.com/)

* Proposed (alongside a post graduate student) a novel end-to-end architecture consisting of two modules for robust pose prediction and **3D instance recognition** via extracting **Marrâ€™s 2.5 D sketches** from images.

* The learned embedding explicitly **disentangles** a shape vector and a pose vector,  which alleviates both pose bias for 3D shape retrieval and categorical bias for pose estimation

* One sub module learns to reconstruct 3D model, from the 2.5D sketches, in its canonical viewpoint via **multi-task learning DNNs**. Another NN sub module uses **Faster R-CNN** style anchor boxes to predict the **6 DoF** poses in continuous domain.

* The method achieves state of the art **10.3 median error** for pose estimation and **0.592 top-1-accuracy** for category agnostic 3D object retrieval on the **Pascal3D+dataset**.
