*Advisor* : [Dawn Song](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~dawnsong/)

**Objective** : _Neural symbolic hybrids for few shot recognition_
* Using **program induction** to sample programs for **few shot image classification**. 

* Training procedure involves Supervised pre-training with **teacher-forcing** followed by reinforcement learning using [Hindsight Experience Replay](https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.01495).

* We use **memory augmented networks** with attention to allow multiple chains of execution.

**Objective** : _Meta learning in SQL query synthesis_
* Divided the [Spider](https://yale-lily.github.io/spider) dataset into 13 meta categories.

* We use **transformers** to generate embeddings for natural language question tokens.

* A **meta-training phase** for decoder to learn predicting the **structure** of SQL query

* A **domain specific training** phase for token prediction using a separate multi head attention module.

**Objective** : _Myelin segmentation in 3D mSEM and connectomic analysis_

* We used **3D Unet** trained on **multi Scanning Electron Microscope** raw data to generate 3D segmentation masks

* Dynamically oversampling (with linearly decaying probability) myelinated voxel cubes to provide non-zero gradients countering **highly skewed data** (0.01% positively labeled voxels)

* Reached over **90% precision-recall**. Using the detection to analyze thalamocortical neurons with myelinated axons at the beginning of innervation.

*Advisor* : [Prof. Tat Seng Chua](https://www.chuatatseng.com/)

**Objective**: _Monocular 3D object instance recognition and Pose Estimation_

* Proposed (alongside a post graduate student) a novel end-to-end architecture consisting of two modules for robust pose prediction and **3D instance recognition** via extracting **Marrâ€™s 2.5 D sketches** from images.

* The learned embedding explicitly **disentangles** a shape vector and a pose vector,  which alleviates both pose bias for 3D shape retrieval and categorical bias for pose estimation

* One sub module learns to reconstruct 3D model, from the 2.5D sketches, in its canonical viewpoint via **multi-task learning DNNs**. Another NN sub module uses **Faster R-CNN** style anchor boxes to predict the **6 DoF** poses in continuous domain.

* The method achieves state of the art **10.3 median error** for pose estimation and **0.592 top-1-accuracy** for category agnostic 3D object retrieval on the **Pascal3D+dataset**.
