I have recently graduated from IIT Kanpur in CSE. I would be joining [MPI Brain Research Institute, Frankfurt](https://brain.mpg.de/institute/mission-vision.html) as a visiting research scholar under [Prof. Moritz Helmstaedter](http://brain.mpg.de/research/helmstaedter-department.html). Prior to this I was advised by [Prof. Piyush Rai](https://www.cse.iitk.ac.in/users/piyush/) in my undergraduate studies.

My research interest lie in deep learning with a predilection for computer vision, Augmented Reality, NLP and Human Computer Interaction.
