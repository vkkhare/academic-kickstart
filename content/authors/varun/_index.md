I am currently leading the Federated Learning team at [OpenMined](https://openmined.org) where we are building the first open source library for privacy preserving machine learning. Prior to this, I was a research scholar at UC Berkeley working on neural program synthesis. 

I finished my undergraduate studies from IIT Kanpur in Computer Science and Engineering. After graduation, I went for a year long stint at [MPI for Brain Research](https://brain.mpg.de/home.html) as a visiting research scholar exploring the intricacies of human brain.

My research interest lie in Machine Learning with a predilection for program synthesis, computer vision, and security.
